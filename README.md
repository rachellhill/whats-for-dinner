## Overview

What's for dinner?

The goal of this project was strengthen my understanding of writing Javascript code, utilize the DOM in order to manipulate html and css, and dabble in creating an app that is fully functional. This is an app that generates random sides, main dishes, desserts, and entire meals!

## User Instructions
